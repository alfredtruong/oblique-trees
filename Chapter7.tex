Final remarks. This will contain my thoughts of the implications of this work. Mention R package will be provided (not that it can be made faster). Touch upon addition research areas.\\

\begin{itemize}
\item Using ideal splits as starting points for hill-climbing methods
\item Extending idea to regression trees, using clustering methods
\item Random forests idea over classes to speed up tree growth for large problems
\item Provide an implementation in C to speed up existing R work
\end{itemize}
